Hello everyone,

I managed to install the app and have it running. The whole process ins't very smooth.

Here are various feedbacks:

1 - The app takes ~ 30 seconds to launch after the end of the `make run-android` command. First the app launches. Then a black screen remains for 30 seconds and after that the app displays with the following message :

```

```

After a few deconnections and reconnections, there are also error messages after the last log line :

```
 ERROR  {"_dispatchInstances": {"_debugHookTypes": ...
```

Those 30 seconds look like a timeout. Is it a normal behaviour? Or do I have something blocked on my app on launching?

2- When I enable the Debug mode (after pressing "d" in the metro terminal) an error is thrown:

```
 BUNDLE  ./index.js

 MAP  ./index.js

 LOG  JavaScript logs will appear in your browser console

```

The whole process is then blocked and I have to rerun `make run-android` the have the app running again.

Do you have the same issue?

3 - When I unplug the Android phone from the computer and reconnect it, I have to rerun `make run-android` to have an app running normally. If not, I have the following message in the metro console:

```
warn No apps connected. Sending "reload" to all React Native apps failed. Make sure your app is running in the simulator or on a phone connected via USB.
```

4 - I tried to run re-frisk with `run-re-frisk`. I open the app but no information is displayed and no events are displayed when interacting with the app. Do you have the same problem?

5 - On the good news side, I managed to connect a REPL with Emacs and interact with the application with it. I could explore the app-db, modify it and have the application reacting and rerendering on changes.

6 - Concerning the bounty and to be sure, all the changes have to be made in the `src/status_im2` folder?!

7 - Concerning the ClojureScript scripts or functions to create for the bounty, would it be someting something that describes the scenarios in terms of `rf/dispatch-sync` and `rf-test/wait-for`? When you say "There's some integration tests that do something a bit similar, and could potentially be used (or some of the steps re-used)", you're talking about the appium integration tests?

8 - Is it better to have those technical discussion in the issue itself or in a Github discussion so that it becomes accessible as online documentation?

Thanks
